This app aims to provide health professionals and clients with a way to communicate between appointments. Health professionals will recieve more consistent data on their client's condition. The app allows health professionals to view the client's progress and trends to more carefully plan for the next steps in treatment. The app provides an option for willing friends and family of the client to help log symptoms because it can be hard for the client to recognize them all the time. The app gives power to the client to add or remove participants and the information sent over the app is kept confidential.

This app works by allowing the health professional to create customized surveys catering to the client's condition. This survey is available to the client and the client's chosen associates and can be submitted up to once a day by each person. To make the surveys less time-consuming for all participants, questions are answered using a numerical scale. This data is compiled on the health professional's end into line graph.
